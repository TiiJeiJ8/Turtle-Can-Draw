# Turtle Can Draw
 Use Deep learning and Turtle(Python) to redraw the picture

It's slow but intresting...

Plan:
    Trying to increase drawing speed and keep learning.

Versions:
V1.0.3 (28.11.2024)
    Temporarily remove multiple tortoise synchornization drawing and add restrictions to optimize drawing logic.

V1.0.2 (28.11.2024)
    Multiple Turtles were added for alternate drawing.

V1.0.1 (28.11.2024)
    Basically realize the function of drawing with Turtle.
